Lemurs provides a *Terminal User Interface* (TUI) for a [Display/Login
Managers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Display_manager) in Rust for most
GNU/Linux and BSD distributions. It can work both *with or without SystemD*.
Lemurs works on most Unix systems including Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.

## Goal

This project creates a small, robust and yet customizable Login Manager which
can serve as the front-end to your TTY, X11 or Wayland sessions. Lemurs uses
[_Pluggable Authentication Modules_][pam] (PAM) as its method of authentication.

## Installation

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/lemurs.svg)](https://repology.org/project/lemurs/versions)

Installation follows three steps.

1. Compile the codebase
2. Copy all files to correct positions
3. Enable `init` process to run `lemurs`

### Arch Linux

Lemurs can be installed from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org). This will
build the package on your local machine.

```bash
paru -S lemurs-git # paru can be replaced by any other AUR helper

# Not needed if do don't have a window manager yet
sudo systemctl disable display-manager.service

sudo systemctl enable lemurs.service
```

### Compiling from source

The `install.sh` script can be used to compile and setup the display manager on
your Unix machine. This will perform multiple steps:

1. Build the project in release mode (requires Rust's _cargo_)
2. Setup the `/etc/lemurs` folder which contains some of the configuration and
   necessary files such as your selection of window managers.
3. Disables the previous Display Manager
4. Copies over the _systemd_ service and enables it.

Although you might first want to set up some window managers (see
[Usage](#Usage)), upon rebooting you should now see Lemurs.

## Usage

After installation you can add your environments by creating runnable scripts.

For your Xorg put your [xinitrc](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xinit) scripts
in the `/etc/lemurs/wms` directory. For Wayland, put a script that starts your
compositor in the `/etc/lemurs/wayland` directory. For both cases, the name of
the runnable script file is the name that is shown in the environment switcher
within lemurs. Multiple Xorg and Wayland environments can exist at the same time.

### Example 1: BSPWM

For the [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) window manager, you might
add the script `/etc/lemurs/wms/bspwm`.

```bash
#! /bin/sh
sxhkd &
exec bspwm
```

Remember to make this script runnable. This is done with the `chmod +x
/etc/lemurs/wms/bspwm` command.

Upon rebooting your new `bspwm` should show up within Lemurs.

### Example 2: Sway

For the [sway](https://swaywm.org/) compositor and window manager, you might
add the script `/etc/lemurs/wayland/sway`. Ensure that you have sway installed
and added yourself to the `seat` group.

```bash
#! /bin/sh
exec sway
```

Remember to make this script runnable. This is done with the `chmod +x
/etc/lemurs/wayland/sway` command.

Upon rebooting your new `sway` should show up within Lemurs.

## Configuration

Many parts for the UI can be configured with the `/etc/lemurs/config.toml`
file. This file contains all the options and explanations of their purpose.
The flag `--config <CONFIG FIlE>` can be used to select another configuration
file instead. An example configuration can be found in the `extra` folder in
this repository.

## Preview & Debugging

Lemurs logs a lot of information of it running to a logging file. There are 3
log files.

- `/var/log/lemurs.log`: This is the main log file that contains information
  about the control flow and is the first place you should look.
- `/var/log/lemurs.client.log`: This is the `stdout` and `stderr` of your
  environment. This can help you debug your scripts in the `/etc/lemurs/wms` or
  `/etc/lemurs/wayland` folder.
- `/var/log/lemurs.xorg.log`: This is the `stdout` and `stderr` of the X server.
  This is only used when you run a X11 based environment.

You can disable logging with the `--no-log` flag. This flag can be adding into
your service manager script if you want to disable logging globally.

If you want to test the UI generated by your configuration file you can also run
`lemurs --preview`. This will run a preview instance of your configuration. This
will automatically create a `lemurs.log` in the working directory.
